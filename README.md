By now, you should be familiar with building higher-order functions from scratch. Today, we will focus on three important and useful higher-order functions: `.map()`, `.reduce()`, and `.filter()`.

Whiteboard, create a code plan, and implement each of the following methods:

- `.map()`: A function that takes an array of items and a function, and returns an array with each item manipulated by that function.
- `.reduce()`: A function that takes an array of food orders with their amounts and returns the total amount of all the food orders.
- `.filter()`: A function that takes an array of items and a function, and returns an array with only the items that return true in the function.

To get started, follow these steps:

1. Create a repository called "Higher-Order-From-Scratch".
2. Practice working with branches by creating a new branch called "HigherOrder".
3. Place your code in a file called `main.js`.
4. Create a pull request (PR) for "Higher-Order-From-Scratch" to be merged into the master branch.

- run code: `node main.js`
